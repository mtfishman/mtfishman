### Hi ðŸ‘‹

Hello! I'm Matt Fishman, Associate Data Scientist at the Center for Computational Quantum Physics (CCQ), Flatiron Institute, New York. Lead developer of @ITensor.

- I received my Ph.D. from Caltech in the Spring of 2018. My thesis was on the development of tensor network algorithms.
- I am currently the lead developer of ITensor (co-developed with @emstoudenmire), a leading tensor network software library with applications to quantum physics, quantum computing, machine learning and chemistry.
- Along with @GTorlai I am a co-developer of the PastaQ.jl Julia library for simulating and analyzing quantum computers.
- I primaly code in Julia and C++.
- I am interesting in writing simple to use and high performance code.
- I am most excited about my recent work in applying tools like automatic differentiation, multithreading, and interactive visualization to improve tensor network software and algorithms.
- I am interested in working more on applying GPUs and distributed computing to tensor network software.
- Check out my repositories and reach out with any questions you have or if you are interested in contributing to the ITensor ecosystem!
